Are you tired of copy pasting code ? Are you tired of the fact that there's no notion of convinience APIs provided by eclipse ?

If the answer to the above questions is yes, this project is for you. This is a project where you can push that nice 4 line snippet of convenience APIs that you use all over the place.

If you're interested in contributing, please fork the repository and ask us to pull. Of course read the CONTRIBUTING file :)
